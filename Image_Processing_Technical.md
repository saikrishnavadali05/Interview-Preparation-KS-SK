[0033] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended diagrams is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure rather the detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the inventive subject matter.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in every case and that in some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form for clarity of presentation

[0038] An example device for capturing image frames using one or more image sensors, such as a smartphone, may include a configuration of two, three, four, or more cameras on a backside (e.g., a side opposite a user display) or a front side (e.g., a same side as a user display) of the device. Devices with multiple image sensors include one or more image signal processors (ISPs), Computer Vision Processors (CVPs) (e.g., AI engines), or other suitable cir- cuitry for processing images captured by the image sensors. One or more of the image sensors may include a reconfigur- able binning module. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the image signal processors (ISPs) may include a reconfigurable binning module. The one or more image signal processors may provide processed image frames to a memory and/or a processor (such as an application proces- sor, an image front end (IFE), an image processing engine (IPE), or other suitable processing circuitry) for further pro- cessing, such as for encoding, storage, transmission, or other manipulation.
