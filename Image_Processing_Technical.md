[0038] An example device for capturing image frames using one or more image sensors, such as a smartphone, may include a configuration of two, three, four, or more cameras on a backside (e.g., a side opposite a user display) or a front side (e.g., a same side as a user display) of the device. Devices with multiple image sensors include one or more image signal processors (ISPs), Computer Vision Processors (CVPs) (e.g., AI engines), or other suitable cir- cuitry for processing images captured by the image sensors. One or more of the image sensors may include a reconfigur- able binning module. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the image signal processors (ISPs) may include a reconfigurable binning module. The one or more image signal processors may provide processed image frames to a memory and/or a processor (such as an application proces- sor, an image front end (IFE), an image processing engine (IPE), or other suitable processing circuitry) for further pro- cessing, such as for encoding, storage, transmission, or other manipulation.
