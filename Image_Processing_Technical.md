[0033] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended diagrams is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure rather the detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the inventive subject matter.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in every case and that in some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form for clarity of presentation

0034 recording high dynamic range or HDR photographs with an image capture device uses two or more exposures at different exposures to capture detail in a variety of shadow and highlight regions. In some configurations HDR photographs can be captured simultaneously from a single image sensor by controlling different groups of pixels within the image sensor to capture different exposures of the scene such as by controlling groups of pixels to capture different exposure lengths one benefit of the simultaneous capture of different exposures is reduced motion blur that could result when recording exposure sequentially in time however the simultaneous capture of different exposures results in each exposure having a resolution that is a fraction of the full resolution of the image sensor

0035 space shortcomings mentioned here are only representative and are included to highlight problems that the inventors have identified with respect to existing devices and sought to improve upon aspects of devices described below may address some or all of the shortcomings as well as others in the known in the art aspects of the improved devices described here in my present other benefits than and we used in other applications than those described above

0037 particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages or benefits in some aspects the present disclosure provides techniques for achieving high dynamic range photography with intensive zoom operation the image processing using data from for example pixel interleaved sensor may have more detail than a lower resolution photograph or a conventional upscale photography the image processing may be applied to data received from image in search of a variety of color patterns such as Q CFCF or RGB some of the image data received from the image there may be processed at low resolution which reduces power consumption and reduces bandwidth consumption for part of the image processing in some embodiments exposure compensation may be performed to obtain a pseudo full frame long exposure which can further increase details in non high light regions

0038 an example device for capturing image frames using one or more image sensors such as smartphone may include a configuration of 234 or more cameras on a backside example a side opposite a user display or a front side same side as user display of the device devices with multiple image sensors include one or more image signal processors computer vision processors example a engines or other suitable circuitry for processing images captured by the image sensors one or more of the image sensors may include a reconfigurable binning module additionally or alternatively one or more of the image single processors may include a reconfigurable binding module the one or more imaginal processors may provide processed image frames to a memory or a processor such as an application processor an image front end and image processing engine or other suitable processing circuitry for further processing such As for encoding storage transmission or other manipulation

0044 unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions it is appreciated that throughout the presentation application discussions utilizing the terms such as accessing receiving sending using selecting determining normalizing multiplying averaging monitoring comparing applying updating measuring deriving settling generating or the like refer to the actions the process of a computer system are similarly electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical quantities within the computer systems registers and memories into other data similarly represented as required quantities within the computer resistant registers memories or other such information storage transmission or display devices

0045 the terms device and operators are not limited to one or a specific number of physical objects such as one smartphone one camera controller one processing system and so on as used here in your device may be any electronic device with one or more parts that may implement at least some portions of the disclosure while the below description and examples use the term device to describe various aspects of the disclosure the term device is not limited to a specific configuration type or number of objects as used herein an apparatus may include a device or a portion for performing the described operations
